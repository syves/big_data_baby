You should also present some subjective analysis of the results. For example:

*  Is accuracy the best metric for assessing these sources?
*  If we were to choose one of these two sources based on the results of this
experiment, which one would you recommend and why?

1. Accuracy is not the best metric for assessing these sources.

A. We don't know if the criteria being used to determine if a business is closed is relevant or logical.
#We should start by asking the most informative questions we can.

For example perhaps only one question is being asked "Do they have a functioning website?"
B. Perhaps ask more questions: Extra data could be noise...
C. Perhaps payroll is weighted more than recent transactions
D. Historical transaction: compare this quarter to last quarter or same quarter last year
E. How much money do we lose marketing to a closed company versus missing the opportunity to
market to an open company if we assume they are closed?

F. If machine learning is being used there might be a bias toward the majority of cases.
 If most businesses are closed, then our program may decide that more are closed than really are.


Criteria                     | Open  |  Closed
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
working phone                   X        X        #maybe they change it/ or power is out
working webpage :status 200     X        X        #many dead pages out there/server could be down
recent transactions             X        X        #may have residuals/ or be active but in decline
payroll                         X                 #might not be paying people this month! not likely

confusion_matrix(Verifidelity) #=> {'FP': 13, 'TN': 693, 'FN': 52, 'TP': 242}
confusion_matrix(Accutronix) #=> {'FP': 41, 'TN': 755, 'FN': 9, 'TP': 195}

2.  I don't have a background in anaylsis so I am going out on a limb here.
Although accuracy is not the most important feature Accutronix is more accurate than Verifidelity.
Accutronix has a higher true positive rate, margin of 13% determining when a business is closed,
and only 4% lower than Verifidelity when determining if a business is open.

* I started this weekend with no knowledge of any of these metrics, experience with anaylsis or
data visualization. It has been fun and challenging working on this challenge, thinking about
relationships, data relevance, learning new technologies, and writing Python!
