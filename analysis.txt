You should also present some subjective analysis of the results. For example:

*  Is accuracy the best metric for assessing these sources?
*  If we were to choose one of these two sources based on the results of this
experiment, which one would you recommend and why?

1. Accuracy is not the best metric for assessing these sources.

A. We don't know if the criteria being used to determine if a business is closed is relevant or logical.
#We should start by asking the most informative questions we can.

For example perhaps only one question is being asked "Do they have a fucntioning website?"
B. Perhaps ask more questions: Extra data could be noise...
C. Perhaps payroll is weighted more than recent transactions
D. Historical transaction history compared to last quarter or same quarter last year
E. How much money do we lose marketing to a closed company versus missing the oppertunity to 
market to them if we assume they are closed?


Criteria                     | Open  |  Closed    
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
working phone                   X        X        #maybe they change it/ or power is out
working webpage :status 200     X        X        #many dead pages out there/server could be down
recent transactions             X        X        #may have residuals/ or be active but in decline
payroll                         X                 #might not be paying people this month! not likely

confusion_matrix(Verifidelity) #=> {'FP': 13, 'TN': 693, 'FN': 52, 'TP': 242}
onfusion_matrix(Accutronix) #=> {'FP': 41, 'TN': 755, 'FN': 9, 'TP': 195}

2. Accutronix is more accurate than Verifidelity.
 Accutronix has the most TN, we don't waste money marketing to these companies, 73 more than 
Verifidelity, far fewer FN, FP are higher than Verifidelity
